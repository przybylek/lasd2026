This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
First, installs all the dependencies listed within package.json in the local node_modules folder. Run this script once after cloning the repositiry.

```bash
yarn install
```

Then, edit package.json and provide the IP address of your server or change:
```
"dev": "next dev -H yourServerIP",
```
to
```
"dev": "next dev",
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open [http://yourServerIP:3000](http://yourServerIP:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
