    <p>The International Conference on Lean and Agile Software Development (LASD) was established in 2017 as part of the FedCSIS multiconference. Over the years, the conference has evolved to adapt to changing circumstances and explore new opportunities. In 2021 and 2022, LASD was held as an online conference due to the COVID-19 pandemic, making it more accessible to a global audience. In 2023, it became a track within ACM SAC, and in 2024, LASD expanded its reach by being held twice — first at SAC and later at ISD — solidifying its presence in both the Software Engineering and Information Systems communities.</p>
    <p><strong>The objective of LASD is to advance the state-of-the-art in lean and agile software development and disseminate best practices, along with success stories of successful transitions and adaptations to the evolving work environment.</strong></p> 
    <p>LASD has already established itself as a prominent forum where practitioners, researchers, and academics meet to share and discuss their concerns, experience, and research findings. 
 It is also renowned for its conscientious PC members, who diligently provide detailed reviews of journal-quality standards.</p>
<p>Authors of high-quality papers presented at LASD will be invited to submit extended versions of their work for further review and potential publication in 
<em>e-Informatica Software Engineering Journal</em> (<a href="https://www.e-informatyka.pl/index.php/einformatica/">EISEJ</a>, IF: 1.2) and <em>Journal of Computer Languages</em> (<a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-computer-languages">COLA</a>, IF: 1.8).</p>
